Alok Nath being fond of Sanskari Maths has come up with a new mathematical function called the "Sanskari Function". 
This function takes a number n and returns a new number by adding any of the prime factors of n to itself. Eg. 10 + 5 (Prime factor of 10) = 15.
Now Alok Nath is wondering in how many moves he can convert a given number n into another number m by using his Sanskari Function several number of times.
Can you help Alok Nath in finding the minimum number of moves for given 2 integers.

Input -
First line contains an integer T(<=500) denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of 2 positive numbers n and m.

Output -
It consists of a single integer - the minimum number of moves required to convert n into m.
If it is not possible to convert n into m print -1.

Sample Input -
2
6 12
6 13

Sample Output -
2
-1
