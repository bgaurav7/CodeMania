Aloknath's Sanskari son likes a girl. He wants to convey his proposal to her.
But scared of his Sanskari Dad, he decided to pass his proposal indirectly.

He has devised a way of encrypting messages.
He writes the message (letters only) down the columns, padding with extra random letters so as to make a square array of letters. 
For example, if the message is 
“aloknathisverysanskari” 
and there are five columns, Aloknath's son would write down

a a v a r
l t e n i
o h r s #
k i y k #
n s s a #

Note that Aloknath's son includes only letters. In this example, Aloknath's son used the character ‘#’ to pad the message out to make a perfect square, although he could have used any letter. 

Aloknath's son then sends the message to his friend by writing the letters diagnoally. First upward then downard direction(alternatively).

So, the above would be encrypted as

aalotvaehknirnrisyssk##a#
